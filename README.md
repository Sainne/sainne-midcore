# Sainne's Midcore
A '<b>mid</b>' minecraft datapack about limited lives, max health and being a mid-point of Survival and Hardcore.
### Features
All of these are configurable ingame.
#### Limited lives(default: 30)
You have a limited amount of lives when starting the game, making death more of a danger than in normal survival minecraft, but not as punishing as Hardcore would be.
#### Max Hp represent lives(default:1(True))
Your maximum health represents the amount of lives you have left.
#### Totem failure chance(default:5)
The totem will fail in saving its user by this configurable chance, 0 makes it so it always saves the user, anything over 100 makes it esentially useless.
#### Totem saves from void(default:1(True))
The totem will save a player from void if successful.
### Random tips
* The experience could be better paired with <b>gamerule keepInventory true</b>
* For an even harder experience you can use <b>gamerule naturalRegeneration false</b>
* Totems will be a must have.
