# Sainne's Midcore
A '<b>mid</b>' minecraft datapack about limited lives, max health and being a mid-point of Survival and Hardcore.
### Main Mechanic
#### Limited lives
You have a limited amount of lives when starting the game, represented by your maximum health, by default you start with 30 lives(60HP of max health), and lose 1 life(and 2 maximum HP) with each death, making death more of a danger than in normal survival minecraft, but not as punishing as Hardcore would be.
### Tips and tricks
* The experience could be better paired with <b>gamerule keepInventory true</b>
* Measure risks and be careful when you walk, fall damage can be quite deceiving
* For an even harder experience you can use <b>gamerule naturalRegeneration false</b>
### Planned features

  #### Recovering lives and reviving players
  Have a method of gaining lives(should be quite difficult) and reviving dead players giving them 10 more lives(shoul be even more difficult and risky).
  #### Dynamic Difficulty
  Depending on your lives left, the game would be easier when at a lower amount, and harder at higher amounts(configurable/invertable)
  #### Progressive Difficulty
  Make a difficulty modifier dependent on game progression(obtained diamonds, nether, entered stronghold, defeated wither, defeated enderdragon), and locking certain items behind challenges(elytra,mending,netherite,other OP items).
