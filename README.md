# Sainne's Midcore
A '<b>mid</b>' minecraft datapack about limited lives, max health and being a mid-point of Survival and Hardcore.
### Main Mechanic
#### Limited lives
You have a limited amount of lives when starting the game, represented by your maximum health, by default you start with 30 lives(60HP of max health), and lose 1 life(and 2 maximum HP) with each death, making death more of a danger than in normal survival minecraft, but not as punishing as Hardcore would be.
### Tips and tricks
* The experience could be better paired with <b>gamerule keepInventory true</b>
* Measure risks and be careful when you walk, fall damage can be quite deceiving
* For an even harder experience you can use <b>gamerule naturalRegeneration false</b>
### Planned features

  #### Recovering lives and reviving players
  Have a method of gaining lives(should be quite difficult) and reviving dead players giving them 10 more lives(shoul be even more difficult and risky).
  #### Configuration book/menu
  A more intuitive way of changing the configurable values of the datapack, like the starting amount of lives, whether to enable the sync of max hp with the lives, and other added features.
  #### Totem of undying nerfing
  A configurable percentage of failure for the totem of undying for balancing purposes, hypotetically, it would be possible to change it so for example the totem fails at saving from death 5% of the activations.
  
  Or make it so it gives certain debuff effects instead of buffs.
  #### Totem of undying buff
  It would be possible to configure the totem to save from void death(by teleport to near ground or to spawnpoint).
